--- EVERYONE: ---

This codebase is for reference only since it has been written by "Adults", per the REC Foundation Ruling.
- Direct use of the code provided during a competition is not allowed!!!

If used/distributed by the students (such as copy and pasting), the decision is not supported by the 
coaches or our organization. The student takes full responsibility for any punishment that may occur 
proceeding such instance.

This is not intended to be distributed as a general use-case library. Its purpose is to demonstrate 
high level engineering concepts during practice such as:
 - Object oriented programming
 - Custom library creation
 - Feedback control systems
 - Sensor filtering
 - Odometry
 - Pure pursuit

In addition to providing examples for how robotics teams can use such concepts to succeed and solve problems in and 
out of competition. All code must and will be written by the students. It is our full intention to abide
by the REC Foundation student-centered rules: 

 - https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/articles/5449868745367-Student-Centered-Policy 
 - https://www.vexforum.com/t/code-templates-and-student-centered-policy-discussion/115567/15

All public resources for students can either be found commented in the code or within this documentation wiki (See Below). Please use
this as your first source of reference before coming straight to me with trouble shooting issues. I will give you the tools and resources
but it is up to you to problem solve.

--- A Personal Rant ---

As a older member of the VEX community, I do not approve of the stance that competition robotics has taken with the "plug and play" 
open-source libraries teams provide and I believe it goes against the student-centered policies (especially since many other students 
cannot write these functions themselves, demonstrate the concepts, or even provide a proper reason as to why they would use someone 
elses library).
(See below for general REC ruling) 
- "Students use a custom library developed by another team, but cannot create their own custom libraries." 

For clarity, libraries are not bad, in fact I believe quite the opposite - but the purpose of VEX is to inspire, grow, and learn. With these libraries, the inspiration and potential for growth
is removed. Their usage without citation and proper understanding is blatent plagarism, especially in a competition environment where trophies may be awarded on percieved "skill". 
As a result, these libraries devalue the time, effort, and experience that many other very talented students have put into their own closed-source libraries which made them stand out.

Continuing, while yes, this is technically a library itself, this is (and always will be) written as more of a wiki (similar to the VexU Sigbots) to properly document, provide resources, 
explain the concepts, and verify it works, so I may better mentor my students through something that is known to be difficult. Hence, this is given as a line by line general use-case 
and is fully commented so ANY student may reverse engineer and better understand the process workflow + math for these technical concepts. 

Trial by fire sucks, and nobody is an expert when they first start - so, sometimes it is best to work from an example and deconstruct the solution.
