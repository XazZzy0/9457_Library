--- EVERYONE: ---

This code is for reference only, since it has been written by "Adults", 
direct use of the code provided during a competition is not allowed!!!

If used/distributed by the students (such as copy and pasting), the decision is not supported by the 
coaches or our organization. The student takes full responsibility for any punishment that may occur 
proceeding such instance.

This is not intended to be distributed as a general use-case library. Its purpose is to demonstrate 
high level engineering concepts during practice such as:
 - Object oriented programming
 - Custom library creation
 - Feedback control systems
 - Sensor filtering
 - Odometry
 - Pure pursuit

In addition to providing examples for how robotics teams can use such concepts to succeed and solve problems in and 
out of competition. All code must and will be written by the students. It is our full intention to abide
by the REC Foundation student-centered rules: 

 - https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/articles/5449868745367-Student-Centered-Policy 
 - https://www.vexforum.com/t/code-templates-and-student-centered-policy-discussion/115567/15

As a older member of the VEX community, I do not approve of the stance that competition robotics has taken with the "plug and play" 
open-source libraries and I believe it goes against the student-centered policies (especially since many students cannot write these 
functions themselves, demonstrate the concepts, or even provide a proper reason as to why they would use someone elses library).
(See below for general REC ruling) 
- "Students use a custom library developed by another team, but cannot create their own custom libraries." 

For clarity, libraries are not bad, in fact quite the opposite. But in a learning environment - it's usage without citation and proper understanding is blatent plagarism. 
Especially in a competition environment such as vex, these libraries devalue the time, effort, and experience that many other very talented students have put into their 
own closed-source libraries which made them stand out.

While yes, this is technically a library itself, this is written as more of a wiki (similar to the VexU Sigbots) to properly document, provide resources, 
explain the concepts, and verify it works so I may better guide my students through something that is known to be difficult. Hence, this is given as a line 
by line general use-case and is fully commented so ANY student may reverse engineer and better understand the process workflow and math for these technical concepts. 

Trial by fire sucks, and nobody is an expert when they first start - so, sometimes it is best to work from an example and deconstruct the solution.
