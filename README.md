--- EVERYONE: ---

This code is for reference only, since it has been written by ME an "Adult", 
direct use of this library during a competition is not allowed!!!

If used/distributed by the students (such as copy and pasting), the decision is not supported by the 
coaches or our organization. The student takes full responsibility for any punishment that may occur 
proceeding such instance.

This is not intended to be distributed as a general use-case library. Its purpose is to demonstrate 
high level engineering concepts during practice such as:
 - Object oriented programming
 - Custom library creation
 - Feedback control systems
 - Sensor filtering
 - Odometry
 - Pure pursuit

In addition to providing examples for how robotics teams can use such concepts to succeed and solve problems in and 
out of competition. All code must and will be written by the students. It is our full intention to abide
by the REC Foundation student-centered rules: 

 - https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/articles/5449868745367-Student-Centered-Policy 
 - https://www.vexforum.com/t/code-templates-and-student-centered-policy-discussion/115567/15
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not approve of the stance that competition robotics has taken with open-source libraries and I believe 
it goes against the student-centered policies (especially since many students cannot write these functions themselves, explain the concepts,
or even properly explain why they use it)
(See below for general REC ruling) 
~ "Students use a custom library developed by another team, but cannot create their own custom libraries." ~

In general, the rules are unenforced and therefore abused which devalues the time, effort, and experience that many other very talented programmers have put into 
their own robot and programming techniques.

For clarity, libraries are not bad, in fact quite the opposite. But in a learning environment - it's usage without citation and proper understanding is plagarism.
Therefore, this library was written to properly document, provide resources, explain the concepts, and verify it works so I may guide my students 
through something that is known to be difficult. Hence, this is given as a line by line general use-case and is fully 
commented so ANY student may reverse engineer and better understand the process workflow and math for these concepts. 

Nobody is an expert when they first start - so sometimes it is best to work from an example and deconstruct the solution.
