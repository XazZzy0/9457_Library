## For East Students

This code repository is for reference only since it has been written by "Adults", per the REC Foundation Ruling.

Direct use of the code provided during a competition is not allowed!!! If used/distributed by the students (such as copy and pasting),
the decision is not supported by the coaches or our organization. The student takes full responsibility for any punishment that may occur 
proceeding such instance.

This code is not to be distributed as a general use-case library. Its purpose is to demonstrate how to apply code to theory for students who are
unfamiliar with the process workflow. Additionally this provides a learning opportunity by them getting into higher level engineering/software concepts such as:
 - Object oriented programming
 - Reference/Pointer operation
 - Custom library creation
 - Feedback control systems
 - Sensor filtering
 - Odometry
 - Pure pursuit (Coming soon)

This helps to direct ANY robotics teams towards the correct direction to succeed and solve problems in and 
out of competition. All code must and will be written by the students, and it is our full intention to abide
by the REC Foundation student-centered rules: 

 - https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/articles/5449868745367-Student-Centered-Policy 
 - https://www.vexforum.com/t/code-templates-and-student-centered-policy-discussion/115567/15

All public resources for students can either be found commented within the code or within this wiki link (See Below). Please use
this as your first source of reference before coming to the coaches with trouble shooting issues. I will give you the tools and resources
but it is up to you to figure out how to use them.

## A Personal Rant 

I do not approve of the stance that competition robotics has taken with the "plug and play" 
open-source libraries teams provide, and I believe it goes against the student-centered policies, especially since many other students 
cannot write these functions themselves, demonstrate the concepts, or even provide a proper reasoning as to why they would start using 
someone elses library.

See below for general REC ruling 
- "Students use a custom library developed by another team, but cannot create their own custom libraries." 

For clarity, libraries are not bad, in fact I believe quite the opposite. But, as someone with many years of design experience in engineering competitions, the purpose of VEX is to inspire, 
grow, and learn. With these libraries, the inspiration and potential for growth is removed. Their usage without citation and proper understanding is blatent plagarism, 
especially in a competition environment where trophies may be awarded on percieved "skill".  As a result, these libraries devalue the time, effort, and experience that many 
other very talented students have put into their own closed-source libraries which made them stand out.

Continuing, while yes, this is technically a library itself, this is (and always will be) written as more of a wiki/forum (similar to the VexU Sigbots) to properly document, provide resources, 
explain the concepts, and verify these methods work. With this, I may better mentor all of my students through something that is known to be difficult. Hence, The reasoning as to why the code is given as a line by line
general use-case. I want you to learn, so it is fully commented so ANYBODY can reverse engineer and better understand the process workflow + math for these technical concepts.

The trial by fire mentality sucks, and a fundemental lack of understanding is expected when you first start - Do everything properly, by putting in the TIME and EFFORT and that will always be your roadmap to success.
Take pride in yourself and your team, and remember, the best piece of engineering advice I have ever recieved is: "If you look at something long enough, you will figure it out".
