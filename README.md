## Notice For East Students & Viewers

This code repository is for reference only since it has been written by "Adults", per the REC Foundation Ruling.

**Direct use of the code provided during a competition is absolutely not allowed!!!** If used/distributed by the students (such as through copying and pasting),
the decision is not supported by the coaches or our organization. The student takes full responsibility for any internal and external punishment that will occur 
proceeding such an instance.

The purpose of this codebase is to demonstrate how to apply theory into code for students who are unfamiliar with the process workflow and/or concepts.
This provides a guarenteed learning opportunity for them to get into higher-level engineering/software concepts such as:
 - Object Oriented Programming
 - Reference/Pointer operation
 - Custom library creation
 - Feedback control systems
 - Sensor filtering
 - Odometry
 - Pure pursuit (Coming soon)

This helps to direct ANY robotics teams in the correct direction to succeed and solve problems in and 
out of competition. All code must and will be written by the students, and it is our full intention to abide
by the REC Foundation student-centered rules: 

 - https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/articles/5449868745367-Student-Centered-Policy 
 - https://www.vexforum.com/t/code-templates-and-student-centered-policy-discussion/115567/15

All public resources for students can either be found commented within the code or within the wiki link (See Above). Please use
this as your first source of reference before coming to the coaches with troubleshooting issues. Us coaches will be very hands off! 
I will give you all the tools and resources but it is up to you to figure out how to use them!

**Remember** : The best engineering advice I have ever received is: "If you look at something long enough, you will figure it out".

## My Pledge
I'll always mentor my students to do everything properly and will always **prove** that by putting in the TIME and EFFORT, it'll always be the roadmap to success. All information given **WILL ONLY** be used for student reference. The repository and the website provided is (and always will be) written in the format of a education wiki (just like the BLRS Wiki) to properly document, provide resources, explain the concepts, and verify these methods work. With this, I may better mentor all of my students through something that is known to be difficult. Everything provided is fully commented/explained so ANYBODY can reverse engineer and better understand the process workflow + math for these technical concepts. 

**For Students Reading**

History has proven time and time again that a complete and thorough understanding of any topic leads to the next wave of innovators. 
The trial-by-fire mentality sucks, and a fundamental lack of understanding is expected when you first start. Never be embarrassed with technical ignorance and don't be afraid to question everything. After all, The expert was once the apprentice...

On one final note: Always take pride in yourself, your efforts, and your team, since it is your mark in this program.

## A Personal Rant

I do not approve of the stance that competition robotics has taken with the "plug-and-play"  open-source code libraries that other teams provide, and I believe it goes against the student-centered policies, especially since many other students 
cannot write these functions themselves, demonstrate the concepts, or even provide proper reasoning as to why they would start using someone else's library.

**See below for the REC ruling**
- "Students use a custom library developed by another team, but cannot create their own custom libraries." 

I fully comprehend VEX's stance on the matter and the difficulty in arbitrating any policy that enforces a more thorough ruling, but this creates an issue that relies solely on student honesty, which at a top level (at Worlds) has already 
proven to have many issues. 

For clarity, My argument is not that libraries are bad. In fact, I believe quite the opposite. My concern on this subject will always be any student's potential for growth. As someone who's had exposure to many years of engineering competitions across different fields, 
the purpose of any engineering competition has always been to inspire, grow, and learn skills and concepts from a fundamental level. With these libraries, the inspiration and potential for growth are removed. Their usage without citation and proper understanding is blatant plagiarism, especially in a competition environment where trophies may be awarded on perceived "skill".  As a result, these libraries devalue the time, effort, and experience that many 
other very talented students have put into their own closed-source libraries, which made them stand out.
